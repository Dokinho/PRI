# NetPizza
This project served as the capstone project for the Internet Programming and Software Engineering university courses.
It's a straightforward web application designed for online pizza ordering.

## Instructions
### Running the server
1. Checkout git branch `app-fix-for-2024`
2. In the root directory, run `php spark serve`

### Other
- Due to the age of the project, not all features of the application work.
- Changes were made on the branch "app-fix-for-2024" so that some parts of the app could still work.
- For complete functionality, additional code refactoring is needed.
